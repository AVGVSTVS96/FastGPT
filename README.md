# tutorGPT

This is the start of what will become tutorGPT, a platform that helps users solve problems without giving them the solutions. Instead tutorGPT will provide hints and education in the topics needed for the user to figure out the problems on their own.

tutorGPT will be careful to not divulge the solution accidentally, and will be toughtful with hints and relevant education.

As of now I have built a very basic interface with the help of GPT-4 and a tutorial I found. The app is very simple, messages are shown in chat bubbles and it's working well.

TODO:
- [x] Add system role to steer AI behavior 
- [ ] Move chat input to the bottom of the chatbox
- [ ] Style the UI and chat bubbles with CSS
- [ ] Add character streaming functionality
- [ ] Add the ability to switch between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
- [ ] Add a system for saving chats and revisit them later
- [ ] Create tutorGPT prompt
