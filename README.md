# flaskGPT

This is the start of what will become flaskGPT, a customizable platform with a tutor mode that helps users solve problems without giving them the solutions. Instead flaskGPT will provide hints and education in the topics needed for the user to figure out the problems on their own.

flaskGPT will be careful to not divulge the solution accidentally, and will be toughtful with hints and relevant education.
